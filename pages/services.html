    <p><strong>Horizontal Directional Drilling</strong></p>
    <p>Our Horizontal Directional Drill (HDD) fleet includes drilling and boring equipment suitable for both large and small projects.
      Our biggest drill rigs are capable of larger diameter bores allowing for installation of multiple conduits or steel casing.
      Depending on soil conditions and the type of pipe being installed, the larger drills are capable of bore lengths up to 800 feet.
      They are also capable of drilling through most rocky soils.</p>

    <p>Our compact directional drills are suitable for residential and smaller locations where set up
      space is restricted. When a worksite is too small to allow for directional boring equipment,
      pneumatic missile boring may be utilized. Contact us with your project needs and let us explain
      how we can help get your job done.</p>

    <p><strong>Vacuum Excavating</strong></p>  
    <p>Vacuum excavators are used for potholing to locate utilities prior to drilling and to
      suction drill slurry as necessary during the drilling process.</p>

    <p><strong>Missile Boring</strong></p>
    <p>When worksite will not allow for directional boring equipment, pneumatic missile boring can be utilized.</p> 

    <p><strong>Televised Sewer Inspection</strong></p>
    <p>Our sewer main camera system with a lateral launching camera allows us to provide televised inspection of sewer mains as well as
       lateral service lines. By using the lateral launcher from the main sewer line, it is not necessary to enter private homes and
        businesses to access the individual service lines. Our cameras are equipped with sondes and locating equipment which allow us to
         measure the location and depths of both main and service lines.</p>
