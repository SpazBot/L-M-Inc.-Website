      <strong><u>What is Directional Boring?</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Directional Boring, also known as Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD is the most efficient method to install underground utilities.
Directional boring eliminates the need for open trenching or open cutting roadways, reducing interruption to traffic and disturbance
to landscape and existing surfaces. 
    </p>

    <p><strong><u>HDD Applications</u></strong></p>
    <p>Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD), also called Directional Boring and directional drilling, is a method of installing underground pipes and conduits from the surface along a prescribed bore path. Installation lengths up to 6500' have been completed and diameters up to 48" have been installed in shorter runs. Most installations are considerably shorter and smaller diameter. The process is used for installing telecommunications & power cable conduits, water lines, sewer lines, gas lines, oil lines, product pipelines and casings used for environmental remediation. It is used for crossing waterways, roadways, congested areas, environmentally sensitive areas and any area where other methods are more expensive or not feasible. Use of HDD is growing rapidly and is expected to continue to increase for the foreseeable future.

    <p><strong><u>The HDD Procedure</u></strong></p>
    <p><strong><u>Planning</u></strong></p>
    <p>
      Every project begins with thoughtful planning. Ground conditions are determined, surrounding utilities positively located, bore profile is surveyed and plotted, safety and environmental issues are considered before work commences.
